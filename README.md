# Prompt-Engineering Principles

This repository contains Python scripts demonstrating various **Prompt Engineering** techniques for working with Large Language Models (LLMs). Each script explores a different principle to enhance the effectiveness of AI interactions.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Prompt engineering is a crucial technique in optimizing the performance of LLMs, helping them generate accurate, useful, and context-aware responses. This repository explores several key principles:

### Included Techniques:
1. **Chain of Thought (CoT)** - Encourages step-by-step reasoning to improve complex problem-solving.
2. **Few-Shot Learning** - Provides multiple examples to guide the modelâ€™s responses.
3. **Clear Instructions** - Ensures precise guidance to improve output accuracy.
4. **Justification** - Requests explanations to enhance model reliability.
5. **Many Inputs** - Generates multiple responses and selects the best one.
6. **Repeat Instructions** - Mitigates recency bias by reinforcing instructions.
7. **Subtasks** - Breaks down complex tasks into smaller steps.
8. **Delimiters** - Uses structured delimiters for clarity in prompts.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
Ensure you have Python installed and set up an OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

Then, run any script using:

```bash
python filename.py
```

For example:

```bash
python Chain-of-thought.py
```

## ðŸ”¥ Why Use These Techniques?
- **Improves accuracy and reasoning** in AI-generated responses.
- **Enhances user interaction** by structuring the AIâ€™s thought process.
- **Minimizes hallucinations** by ensuring the model follows logic.
- **Optimizes LLM responses** for better control and predictability.
